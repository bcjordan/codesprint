#Palindromes (90 Points)
#Given a string, you keep swapping any two characters in the string randomly till the string becomes a palindrome.
#What is the expected number of swaps you will make? There will always be at least one palindrome which can be formed with the letters of the given string.
#Input:
#The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains a string each.
#Output:
#Output T lines containing the answer for the corresponding test case. Print the answer rounded to exactly 4 decimal places.
#Constraints:
#T <= 10000
#The length of the string will be at most 8 characters.
#The string will consist of only lower-case letters 'a'-'z'.

#Sample Input:
#4
#b
#bb
#abb
#cbaabbb
#Sample Output:
#0.0000
#0.0000
#3.0000
#59.3380
#
#Explanation:
#For the first two cases, the string is already a palindrome so no swaps are needed.
#For the third case, there are 3 possible swaps. The string will become "bab","bba" or remain "abb" with 1/3rd probability each. It's easy to see that the expected number of swaps needed is 3.0000
#For the last case, the answer is 59.337962..., which should be printed as 59.3380
